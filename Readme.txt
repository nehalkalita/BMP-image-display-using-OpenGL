
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION ##
  A C++ program to read BMP file and display it using OpenGL points. 
It is executed in Visual Studio 2015. 2D images are mostly represented 
in the form of pixels and the filters applied on them mostly processes 
all the pixels. The method used in this experiment offers flexibility 
to individual pixels to get handled independently. Hence it permits 
filters to process individual pixels.


The project files are stored in 'Fileread1.7z'

Outputs are displayed in Projection1.bmp and Projection2.bmp
